<h2>Plugins</h2>
		
Plugins allow the application to be extended by the end user without modifying core code.
		
All plugins are defined in Administrator component options Plugins tab.  There is a parameter
for the Membership DB and the Contacts DB.  Each is a comman separated list of plugin names.

A plugin with a name of "Run Example One" is implemented by the file run_example_one.php

Custom plugin PHP code should be uploaded to the folder:
		
&gt;Joomla Root&lt;/components/com_cs_crm/helpers/plugins/xx
where xx is either members or contacts.

Look at one of the included example plugins to see the class that is used to run the plugin.
Returning true from execute() will cause the Joomla framework to continue, false will cause a jexit.
